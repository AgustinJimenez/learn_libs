To put this folder on the PATH environment variable type

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"
This appends the folder to your existing PATH, however, it is only active for your current terminal session.

If you want it to be automatically set, it depends on the shell you are using. For bash you can append this line to $HOME/.bashrc using your favourite editor or type the following on the shell

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
In order to check if it worked, logout and login again or execute

source ~/.bashrc
on the shell.

PS: For other systems where there is no ~/.bashrc, you can also put this into ~/.bash_profile



echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin
source ~/.bashrc

FORGOT PASSWORD
===


    Run bashand make a note of your Linux username (this need not match your Windows username), see How can I find out my user name?

    In Windows admin command prompt (Super+X, A) change the default user to root:

    lxrun /setdefaultuser root

    Now Bash on Ubuntu on Windows logs you in as root without asking password

    Use passwd command in Bash to change the user password (the user whose password you want to reset):

    passwd your_username

    Change the default user back to your normal user in Windows command prompt

    lxrun /setdefaultuser your_username

Need to update your version of Node.js? Here's how you can upgrade or downgrade from the command line using NPM.

Upgrading to the latest stable version

This will update you to the latest available stable version:

sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
Upgrading to the latest LTS version

Node also offers a long-term support (LTS) version. If you need that version (or any other), simply specify the version number you want:

sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 4.4.2
Checking your Node version

To see which version of Node is currently installed, simply run:

node -v

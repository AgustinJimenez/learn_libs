Jquery Installation

The jquery and jquery-ujs files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. If they're not already in app/assets/javascripts/application.js by default, add these lines:
===========================

//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
If you want to use jQuery 2, you can require jquery2 instead:

//= require jquery2
//= require jquery_ujs
And if you want to use jQuery 3, you can require jquery3:

//= require jquery3
//= require jquery_ujs

===========================
BOOTSTRAP INSTALLATION

a. Ruby on Rails

bootstrap-sass is easy to drop into Rails with the asset pipeline.

In your Gemfile you need to add the bootstrap-sass gem, and ensure that the sass-rails gem is present - it is added to new Rails applications by default.

gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3.6'
gem 'sass-rails', '>= 3.2'
bundle install and restart your server to make the files available through the pipeline.

Import Bootstrap styles in app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss:

// "bootstrap-sprockets" must be imported before "bootstrap" and "bootstrap/variables"
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";
bootstrap-sprockets must be imported before bootstrap for the icon fonts to work.

Make sure the file has .scss extension (or .sass for Sass syntax). If you have just generated a new Rails app, it may come with a .css file instead. If this file exists, it will be served instead of Sass, so rename it:

$ mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
Then, remove all the *= require_self and *= require_tree . statements from the sass file. Instead, use @import to import Sass files.

Do not use *= require in Sass or your other stylesheets will not be able to access the Bootstrap mixins or variables.

Require Bootstrap Javascripts in app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

//= require jquery
//= require bootstrap-sprockets
bootstrap-sprockets and bootstrap should not both be included in application.js.

bootstrap-sprockets provides individual Bootstrap Javascript files (alert.js or dropdown.js, for example), while bootstrap provides a concatenated file containing all Bootstrap Javascripts.
